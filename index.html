            <h3 class="default-how">How I stay committed to learning</h3>
            <p class="default-how-descr">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, 
                then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques 
                into existing projects.
                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share 
                what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>
            <h3 class="default-start">How I got started</h3>
            <p class="default-start-descr">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would 
                take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, 
                I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write 
                short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting 
                my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
